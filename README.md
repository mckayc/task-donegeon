-   **Week of September 6, 2025 (v0.4.64):**
    -   **Bug Bar Consolidation:** The bug recording bar has been consolidated into a more compact and responsive two-row layout to prevent controls from overflowing on smaller screens.

-   **Week of October 27, 2025 (v0.4.27):**
    -   **Snake Minigame Overhaul:** The Snake minigame in the Arcade has been significantly improved for better playability. The game window is now larger, the initial speed is slower, a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown has been added, and players can now restart the game by pressing any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen.
    -   **Global Condition Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete. The global condition check now correctly excludes the quest being evaluated from its own group's completion requirements.

-   **Week of October 20, 2025 (v0.4.25):**
    -   **Conditional Market Unlocks:** Locked markets now show a dialog detailing the specific conditions a user must meet to gain access, mirroring the functionality of locked quests.

    -   **Circular Dependency Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.
    -   **Refactored Logic:** Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.

    -   Developed and launched the full AI Teacher feature, moving from a backend foundation to a full-screen UI with an interactive "Teach, Check, Feedback" loop and robust tool-calling for quizzes.
    -   Fixed issues with AI Teacher button responsiveness and made minor improvements to Kiosk Mode and item approval defaults.

-   **Week of September 29, 2025 (v0.1.96 - v0.3.0):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Overhaul:** Re-architected Kiosk Mode to be a more stable URL-based system (`/kiosk`), patching critical security and login flow bugs.
    -   **AI Foundations:** Implemented the backend foundation for the AI Teacher feature with stateful chat sessions.

-   **Week of September 22, 2025 (v0.1.90 - v0.1.95):**

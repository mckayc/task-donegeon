## ‚ú® Features

### What's New in Version 0.1.71 (September 9, 2025)
-   **Robust File Pathing Fix:** Resolved a stubborn avatar display issue by replacing all hardcoded absolute paths in the backend with dynamically resolved paths. This ensures the server can reliably locate and serve uploaded files (avatars, assets) and the database, regardless of the deployment environment.

### What's New in Version 0.1.70 (September 8, 2025)
-   **Avatar Display Fix:** Resolved an issue where uploaded avatar images would appear broken in the development environment due to a missing server proxy configuration for media files.

### What's New in Version 0.1.69 (September 7, 2025)
-   **Avatar System Simplification:** The avatar system has been streamlined. It no longer uses a layered system for equipped items and instead displays a single, user-uploaded profile picture. This resolves display issues and simplifies the user experience.
-   **Optimized Avatar Resizing:** The image cropper now resizes uploaded photos to a web-friendly 512x512 pixels, significantly reducing file sizes for faster performance and less storage usage.

### What's New in Version 0.1.68 (September 6, 2025)
-   **Avatar Upload Optimization:** Cropped avatar uploads are now saved as JPEGs instead of PNGs, resulting in significantly smaller file sizes and faster uploads.
-   **Avatar Display Fix:** Resolved an issue where uploaded profile pictures would sometimes appear as broken images. The avatar component now correctly handles rendering custom profile pictures alongside equipped items.
-   **Reliable Picture Removal:** Fixed a bug where the "Remove Picture" button would not work reliably. It now correctly clears the user's profile picture on the first click.

### What's New in Version 0.1.67 (September 5, 2025)
-   **Avatar Upload Fix:** Resolved a race condition that could cause avatar uploads to intermittently fail after cropping. The upload process is now more reliable.

### What's New in Version 0.1.66 (September 4, 2025)
-   **Consistent Mobile Management Pages:** Applied the responsive card layout, previously on the "Manage Quests" page, to all other management pages (Users, Items, Markets, Trophies, etc.). This creates a unified, touch-friendly experience for administrators on mobile devices.

### What's New in Version 0.1.65 (September 3, 2025)

-   **Version Bump:** Incremented application version number to trigger update notifications.

### What's New in Version 0.1.63 (September 1, 2025)
-   **Responsive Manage Quests Page:** The "Manage Quests" page is now fully responsive. It will display a data table on desktop for efficient management and automatically switch to a touch-friendly card view on mobile devices for a better user experience. Bulk selection and actions are supported in both views.

### What's New in Version 0.1.62 (August 31, 2025)
-   **Service Worker Update Reliability:** Overhauled the service worker registration and update detection logic to eliminate a race condition. The application will now reliably show an "Update Available" notification when a new version is ready to be installed.

### What's New in Version 0.1.61 (August 30, 2025)
-   **New Enhanced Number Input:** Replaced all standard number input fields throughout the application with a custom stepper component. This new component features increment/decrement buttons, supports rapid changes by holding the buttons, and allows for easier direct text entry, resolving a long-standing issue with deleting the first digit in a number.

### What's New in Version 0.1.50 (August 27, 2025)

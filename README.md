# Task Donegeon

**Version:** 0.4.54

---

Task Donegeon is a gamified task and chore management application designed for families, groups, or individuals. It turns everyday responsibilities into an engaging medieval-themed role-playing game. Users complete "quests" (tasks), earn virtual currency and experience points (XP), customize their avatars, and level up their characters in a fun and motivating environment. It leverages a powerful backend to persist all data and includes unique features like an **Asset Library** full of pre-made content and a **Suggestion Engine** powered by Google Gemini to help administrators generate new quests and items, making world-building a breeze.

### Version History

#### Week of November 24, 2025 (v0.4.52)
-   **Customizable Dashboard:** All cards on the Dashboard are now collapsible and can be reordered via drag-and-drop. Your preferred layout and collapsed states are saved automatically to your profile, allowing for a personalized view of your most important information.

#### Week of November 17, 2025 (v0.4.46)
-   **eBook Reader Redesign:** The EPUB reader has been completely overhauled with a new UI. It now features permanent, opaque top and bottom bars for controls, an "immersive" mode to hide the UI for distraction-free reading, a scrubbable progress slider for quick navigation, a dedicated "add bookmark" button, and a subtle page-turn animation.

#### Week of November 10, 2025 (v0.4.45)
-   **EPUB Reader Overhaul:** The eBook reader has been significantly upgraded with fullscreen mode, swipe controls, light/dark themes, improved bookmark display (with progress percentage), and database-backed progress syncing for a seamless experience across devices. Session and total time read are now also tracked and displayed.
-   **Media Library Enhancements:** Added the ability to create folders, fixed upload paths, and implemented drag-and-drop for files and folders in the media library.
-   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved an issue allowing users to complete daily duties multiple times and fixed a syntax error on the server.
-   **Quality of Life:** Added timestamps to the approvals page for better tracking.

#### November 3, 2025 (v0.4.28)
-   **The Arcade Expansion:** Five new minigames have been added: Dragon's Dice (Farkle), Rune Breaker, Dungeon Dash, Forge Master, and Archer's Folly.
-   **Arcade Leaderboard:** A new "All-Time Arcade Legends" leaderboard now appears in the Arcade, showing top players based on cumulative scores across all games.
-   **High Score Display:** Each minigame card now proudly displays the name of the current global high score holder.

#### Week of October 27, 2025 (v0.4.27)
-   **Snake Minigame Overhaul:** The Snake minigame in the Arcade has been significantly improved for better playability. The game window is now larger, the initial speed is slower, a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown has been added, and players can now restart the game by pressing any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen.
-   **Global Condition Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete. The global condition check now correctly excludes the quest being evaluated from its own group's completion requirements.

#### Week of October 20, 2025 (v0.4.25)
-   **Conditional Market Unlocks:** Locked markets now show a dialog detailing the specific conditions a user must meet to gain access, mirroring the functionality of locked quests.
-   **Global Conditions:** Introduced "Global" condition sets that can lock content across the entire application, providing a new layer of administrative control.
-   **Circular Dependency Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.
-   **Refactored Logic:** Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.

#### Week of October 13, 2025 (v0.4.05 - v0.4.24)
-   Introduced user-specific and global Condition Sets for granular content control.
-   Revamped Kiosk Mode to be a persistent, device-specific setting.
-   Overhauled Manual Adjustments for flexibility, adding new birthday trophies.
-   Enhanced the AI Teacher with personalization and better question handling.
-   Fixed critical bugs related to Quest Group saving and recurring build failures.

#### Week of October 6, 2025 (v0.1.96 - v0.4.04)
-   Developed and launched the full AI Teacher feature, moving from a backend foundation to a full-screen UI with an interactive "Teach, Check, Feedback" loop and robust tool-calling for quizzes.
-   Fixed issues with AI Teacher button responsiveness and made minor improvements to Kiosk Mode and item approval defaults.

#### Week of September 29, 2025 (v0.1.96 - v0.3.0)
-   **Kiosk Mode Overhaul:** Re-architected Kiosk Mode to be a more stable URL-based system (`/kiosk`), patching critical security and login flow bugs.
-   **AI Foundations:** Implemented the backend foundation for the AI Teacher feature with stateful chat sessions.

#### Week of September 22, 2025 (v0.1.90 - v0.1.95)
-   **Dashboard & Notifications:** Introduced new dashboard widgets and header notifications for pending user items.
-   **Responsive Approvals:** Made the Approvals page fully responsive for mobile devices.
-   **Enhanced Chronicles:** The Chronicles system was updated with a full audit trail for multi-step actions and richer logging details.

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay & Personalization

-   **Reward Rework:** Overhaul the reward system to allow for more complex and interesting rewards, such as items that grant temporary bonuses or unlock special abilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeORM
-   **Database:** SQLite
-   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API
-   **Deployment:** Vercel (or Docker)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   (Optional) Docker and Docker Compose

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file is for sensitive information and should not be committed to version control.

```
# .env

# Required for the AI Suggestion Engine
# Get your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key"

# (Optional) A long, random, secret string for signing authentication tokens.
# The server will work without it, but it's highly recommended for security.
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-string"

# (Optional) For Docker, you can specify a custom path for persistent data.
# This helps ensure your data is saved outside the container.
# APP_DATA_PATH=./my-task-data
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Running

### With Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the application and its backend running.

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose:** Make sure they are installed on your system.
2.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3.  **Access:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. The Vite frontend will be served on port `5173`, and it will automatically proxy API requests to the backend server running on port `3000`.

### Local Development (Without Docker)

1.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the 'backend' directory
    npm start
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
4.  **Run Frontend Dev Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

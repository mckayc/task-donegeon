-   **Week of October 27, 2025 (v0.5.78):**
    -   **Approvals Stability Fix:** Resolved a critical server error that could occur when an administrator approved or rejected a quest completion. The issue was caused by a missing check for the administrator's user object, leading to a crash if their account was in an inconsistent state. The backend is now more resilient and handles this edge case gracefully.

-   **Week of October 20, 2025 (v0.5.77):**
    -   **Enhanced Modifier Application:** Overhauled the "Apply Modifier" dialog in the Triumphs & Trials page. Administrators can now apply a single Triumph or Trial to **multiple users at once**.

When enabled, if a user has an insufficient balance of the specified reward, the system will automatically deduct other currencies or XP of equivalent value to cover the deficit.

-   **Week of October 13, 2025 (v0.5.76):**
    -   **Chronicles Admin Actions:** Enhanced the Chronicles page with administrative actions.

-   **Week of October 13, 2025 (v0.5.72):**

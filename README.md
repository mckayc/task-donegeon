Task Donegeon is a gamified task and chore management application designed for families, groups, or individuals. It turns everyday responsibilities into an engaging medieval-themed role-playing game. Users complete "quests" (tasks), earn virtual currency and experience points (XP), customize their avatars, and level up their characters in a fun and motivating environment. It leverages a powerful backend to persist all data and includes unique features like an **Asset Library** full of pre-made content and a **Suggestion Engine** powered by Google Gemini to help administrators generate new quests and items, making world-building a breeze.

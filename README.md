### Weekly Summaries

-   **Week of May 23, 2026 (v0.5.45):**
    -   **Math Muncher Expansion:** The "Math Muncher" minigame has been massively expanded into a full-featured educational tool. It now includes a curriculum for grades 1-6, each with 10 unique and randomly-selected challenges covering topics from basic arithmetic to simple algebra. To accommodate more complex problems, the game's grid is now dynamic, switching between a `12x12` layout for simple numbers and a `6x6` layout for longer expressions. A new endless progression system has been added: after a player masters all 10 challenges for a grade, the game speed increases for a greater challenge. All previous features like power-ups, combos, and admin-configurable rewards are retained in this new version.

-   **Week of May 16, 2026 (v0.5.44):**
    -   **Math Muncher Overhaul:** The "Math Muncher" minigame has been significantly enhanced with new gameplay mechanics and administrative controls. Key features include: a manual "Munch" action for more skillful play, on-screen controls for mobile devices, a structured level progression system, a score combo multiplier, and various power-ups like extra lives, shields, and enemy freezes. Donegeon Masters can now also configure automatic rewards (XP or Currency) to be given to players for completing a set number of levels, adding a new layer of progression.

-   **Week of May 9, 2026 (v0.5.43):**
    -   **New Minigame - Math Muncher:** A new educational minigame has been added to the Arcade. Inspired by the classic "Number Munchers," this game challenges players to solve math problems on a grid while avoiding enemies. The difficulty is structured by grade level, making it an engaging way to practice arithmetic and other math concepts.

-   **Week of May 2, 2026 (v0.5.42):**
    -   **Currency Exchange Enhancements:** The Exchange Post has been upgraded to be more user-friendly. When a user selects an XP type to pay with, the system now automatically detects and pools the balances of all other XP types with the exact same real-world value. This maximizes the user's purchasing power without adding UI complexity. A new tooltip on the selected XP type provides transparency by showing exactly which XP balances are contributing to the transaction.

-   **Week of April 25, 2026 (v0.5.41):**
    -   **Backup System Refinement:** The backup filename format has been updated to a cleaner, more readable `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_type.extension` structure. An automatic cleanup process has been added to the server startup sequence, which will find and delete any backups created with older filename formats, ensuring a smooth, one-time migration to the new system.

-   **Week of April 18, 2026 (v0.5.40):**
    -   **Backup Management Overhaul:** This update overhauls the automated backup system to prevent old backups from accumulating and introduces a new interface for bulk-deleting manual and automated backups, giving administrators more control over their data. A new "Danger Zone" action has been added to the Settings page to clean up any backups created with the old filename format. The internal application version was also synchronized to ensure new backups are always created in the correct format.

-   **Week of April 11, 2026 (v0.5.39):**
    -   **Suggestion Engine Overhaul:** The Suggestion Engine has been completely overhauled to support generating multiple assets of different types simultaneously. Administrators can now select various asset types (including the newly added Quest Groups), specify quantities for each, and receive a comprehensive list of AI-generated content in a new interactive results view. Each suggestion can be instantly added, edited before adding, or discarded, dramatically accelerating content creation.

-   **Week of April 4, 2026 (v0.5.38):**
    -   **New Media Type - Image Slideshows:** Introduced a new interactive media type for quests. Admins can now create engaging visual narratives or guides by uploading a series of images with captions that users can view in a full-screen slideshow.

-   **Week of March 21, 2026 (v0.5.35):**
    -   **Quest Locking Logic Fix:** Resolved a critical bug where a quest could be locked by a condition that requires the quest itself to be completed. The system now also correctly ignores unavailable quests (e.g., expired or not scheduled for today) when determining lock status.
    -   **Improved Lock Dialog:** The "Quest Locked" dialog has been enhanced to visually distinguish exempted requirements. Self-exempted quests are highlighted in orange, and unavailable quests are greyed out, providing clear information on what tasks are actually required to unlock content.

-   **Week of March 14, 2026 (v0.5.34):**
    -   **Minigame Polish & New Game:** A major update to the Arcade, implementing a new game and refining several others based on user feedback.
        -   **New Game - Wizard's Vortex:** The previously unimplemented "Wizard's Vortex" is now playable! It's a top-down shooter where you defend a central point from waves of monsters by aiming with the mouse and clicking to fire.
        -   **Forge Master Redesign:** The gameplay has been visually overhauled. A sword emoji now swings back and forth, and the player controls a hammer emoji to strike it. The sword's swing speed increases over time for a greater challenge.
        -   **Goblin Ambush Enhancements:** Added a new lose condition where players have three lives and lose one for hitting a friendly gnome. Added "whack" and "ouch" animations for hitting characters.
        -   **Alchemist's Trial Fix:** Corrected a logic bug that prevented the game from advancing past the first round. Added animations for button presses.
        -   **River Crossing Fixes:** Fixed faulty collision detection that caused unfair deaths. The player character is now a classic frog emoji `üê∏`.

-   **Week of March 7, 2026 (v0.5.33):**
    -   **Arcade Overhaul:** A major update to the Arcade with new games and gameplay improvements.
        -   **New Games:** Implemented three new playable games: **Alchemist's Trial** (a Simon-style memory game), **Goblin Ambush** (a whack-a-mole game), and **River Crossing** (a Frogger-style game).
        -   **Forge Master Rework:** Completely redesigned the Forge Master game. It now features a more interactive heat-based mechanic where players must time their strikes to the metal's temperature for optimal scores.
        -   **Dungeon Dash Fixes:** The runner emoji now faces the correct direction, and flying ghost obstacles have been repositioned to make the slide mechanic functional.

-   **Week of February 28, 2026 (v0.5.32):**

        -   **Dungeon Dash Overhaul:** The player is now a running emoji ('üèÉ'). Added a new "slide" mechanic (down arrow) to dodge flying ghost obstacles ('üëª') in addition to jumping over fire pits ('üî•').
        -   **Forge Master Overhaul:** This game has been completely rebuilt. Instead of a simple timing bar, you now strike a piece of metal on an anvil that heats and cools, with sparks flying. Time your strike to the "perfect" heat to maximize your weapon's quality and score.

-   **Week of February 21, 2026 (v0.5.31):**
    -   **Minigame Bonanza:** A major update to the Arcade!

-   **Week of February 14, 2026 (v0.5.10):**
    -   **Kiosk Dimness Logic Refactor:** Refactored the Kiosk Mode dimming feature to use a more intuitive "Dimness Level" control. The percentage now directly corresponds to the screen overlay's opacity, fixing a bug where different levels looked the same and providing more predictable control for administrators.

-   **Week of February 7, 2026 (v0.5.9):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Dimness Fix:** Reworked the Kiosk Mode dimming control to be more intuitive. It now uses a "Screen Brightness" slider where lower values correctly result in a dimmer screen (higher opacity), addressing user confusion about the dimness level's effect.

-   **Week of January 31, 2026 (v0.5.8):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Enhancements:** Overhauled the auto-dimming feature for shared devices. It is now exclusively active in Kiosk Mode, uses the globally-managed screen dimming overlay for reliability, and respects the dimness level set in the admin settings.
    -   **Dimness Preview:** Added a "Preview" button in the Kiosk Mode settings, allowing administrators to test the configured dimness level for 5 seconds.
    -   **UI Cleanup:** Removed the redundant manual "Dim Screen" toggle from the user profile dropdown.

-   **Week of January 17, 2026 (v0.5.6):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Enhancements:** Added new administrative controls for shared devices.
    -   **Battery Display:** Admins can now enable a battery level indicator in the Kiosk Mode header, perfect for managing shared tablets.
    -   **Auto-Dimming:** A new feature allows admins to configure automatic screen dimming during specific hours (e.g., at night). The screen will dim after a set period of inactivity and instantly brighten on touch, saving power and reducing screen burn-in.

-   **Week of January 10, 2025 (v0.5.5):**
    -   **Quest Timers:** Implemented a new feature allowing administrators to add timers to quests. This includes a "Stopwatch" mode for tracking time spent and a "Countdown" mode for tasks requiring a minimum duration (e.g., reading for 20 minutes).
    -   **Persistent Timer Widget:** When a timed quest is started, a persistent widget appears in the header, allowing users to navigate the app while keeping track of their active quest. Clicking the widget returns the user to the quest details.
    -   **Timer in Approvals:** The time recorded for a completed timed quest is now displayed on the Approvals page for administrators to review.

-   **Week of December 13, 2025 (v0.4.82):**
    -   **Quest Group Exemptions:** Added the ability to exempt entire Quest Groups from "Global" Condition Sets, allowing admins to create categories of quests that will always be available regardless of other global rules.

    -   **Bug Bar Consolidation:** The bug recording bar has been consolidated into a more compact and responsive two-row layout to prevent controls from overflowing on smaller screens.

-   **Week of September 1, 2025 (v0.4.61):**
    -   **Rank & Leaderboard Logic Overhaul:** Ranks and the main Leaderboard are now calculated based on a user's *total lifetime XP earned from quests*, rather than their current XP balance. This provides a more accurate and fair representation of a user's overall progress that isn't affected by spending rewards. The Rank Card on the dashboard has been updated to display both current balances and total earned values for clarity.

-   **Week of September 1, 2025 (v0.4.60):**
    -   **Quest Scheduling Fix:** Implemented a new rule preventing users from completing "Duty" quests on days they are not scheduled to be active. Users now receive a notification explaining why the quest is unavailable, improving clarity and preventing incorrect completions.

-   **Week of November 24, 2025 (v0.4.52):**

-   **Week of November 10, 2025 (v0.4.45):**
    -   **EPUB Reader Overhaul:** The eBook reader has been significantly upgraded with fullscreen mode, swipe controls, light/dark themes, improved bookmark display (with progress percentage), and database-backed progress syncing for a seamless experience across devices.

    -   **Global Condition Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete. The global condition check now correctly excludes the quest being evaluated from its own group's completion requirements.

-   **Week of October 20, 2025 (v0.4.25):**
    -   **Conditional Market Unlocks:** Locked markets now show a dialog detailing the specific conditions a user must meet to gain access, mirroring the functionality of locked quests.
    -   **Global Conditions:** Introduced "Global" condition sets that can lock content across the entire application, providing a new layer of administrative control.
    -   **Circular Dependency Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.
    -   **Refactored Logic:** Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.

-   **Week of October 13, 2025 (v0.4.05 - v0.4.24):**
    -   Introduced user-specific and global Condition Sets for granular content control.

-   **Week of October 6, 2025 (v0.3.01 - v0.4.04):**
    -   Developed and launched the full AI Teacher feature, moving from a backend foundation to a full-screen UI with an interactive "Teach, Check, Feedback" loop and robust tool-calling for quizzes.
    -   Fixed issues with AI Teacher button responsiveness and made minor improvements to Kiosk Mode and item approval defaults.

-   **Week of September 29, 2025 (v0.1.96 - v0.3.0):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Overhaul:** Re-architected Kiosk Mode to be a more stable URL-based system (`/kiosk`), patching critical security and login flow bugs.
    -   **AI Foundations:** Implemented the backend foundation for the AI Teacher feature with stateful chat sessions.

-   **Week of September 22, 2025 (v0.1.90 - v0.1.95):**
    -   **Dashboard & Notifications:** Introduced new dashboard widgets and header notifications for pending user items.
    -   **Responsive Approvals:** Made the Approvals page fully responsive for mobile devices.
    -   **Enhanced Chronicles:** The Chronicles system was updated with a full audit trail for multi-step actions and richer logging details.

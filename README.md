### Weekly Summaries

-   **Week of November 27, 2025 (v0.5.27):**
    -   **AI Tutor Overhaul & Bug Fixes:** A major overhaul of the AI Tutor feature to improve stability and user experience. Fixes a critical bug where the AI would show raw tool code instead of interactive questions during a lesson. The UI has been redesigned to separate conversation from quizzes, and the chat now auto-scrolls correctly. Also resolves an issue where the last question of the initial quiz was always marked incorrect.

-   **Week of November 27, 2025 (v0.5.26):**
    -   **Sidebar Interactivity Fix:** Fixed bugs where the "Chat" link in the sidebar was unresponsive and collapsed section headers (e.g., "Content Management") were not interactive. Clicking a collapsed header icon now correctly opens a persistent flyout menu to access its sub-links.

-   **Week of November 20, 2025 (v0.5.25):**
    -   **Arcade Enhancements:** Added a "Rules" button to every minigame in the Arcade, which opens a dialog explaining the objective and controls for that game.

-   **Week of November 13, 2025 (v0.5.24):**
    -   **Sidebar UI/UX Fix:** Fixed a bug where section headers in the sidebar (e.g., "Content Management") were missing their icons when expanded. Additionally, when the sidebar is collapsed, these headers are now interactive; hovering over their icons reveals a flyout menu of their child links, fixing an issue where they were previously unclickable.

-   **Week of November 6, 2025 (v0.5.23):**
    -   **AI Tutor Readability & UX:** The AI Tutor now displays a friendly welcome message while it prepares its initial quiz. The font size for both chat messages and quiz answers has been increased for better readability, improving the overall user experience.

-   **Week of October 30, 2025 (v0.5.22):**
    -   **AI Tutor Enhancements:** Resolved a configuration issue causing the "Manage AI Tutors" sidebar link to appear without a text label on new installations. Added a new "General Instructions" field to the AI Tutor editor, allowing administrators to provide overarching guidelines to the AI during tutoring sessions.

-   **Week of October 23, 2025 (v0.5.21):**
    -   **AI Tutor Enhancements:** Fixed a bug where the "Manage AI Tutors" sidebar link was missing its text label. Added a new "General Instructions" field to the AI Tutor editor to allow for better personalization of the tutor's behavior, which is now passed to the AI during sessions.

-   **Week of October 16, 2025 (v0.5.20):**
    -   **Sidebar Label Fix:** Fixed a UI bug where the "Manage AI Tutors" link in the sidebar was missing its text label due to an incomplete backend configuration. The terminology is now correctly displayed.

-   **Week of October 9, 2025 (v0.5.19):**
    -   **Automated Backup Cleanup Fix:** Resolved a critical bug where the system would fail to delete old automated backups according to the defined schedule limits, causing an excessive number of backup files to accumulate.

-   **Week of October 2, 2025 (v0.5.18):**
    -   **AI Tutor UX Fix:** Resolved a bug where the AI Tutor would display multiple-choice questions as raw code in the main chat area.

-   **Week of September 25, 2025 (v0.5.17):**
    -   **AI Tutor UX Improvement:** Fixed a critical bug where multiple-choice questions from the AI Tutor could appear as raw code in the chat. The interaction model has been redesigned: the main chat area is now reserved for conversation, while all interactive questions appear in a dedicated panel on the right, providing a cleaner and more stable learning experience.

-   **Week of October 9, 2025 (v0.5.16):**
    -   **Approvals Page Stability Fix:** Fixed a critical state management bug on the Approvals page where acting on one item (approving or rejecting) would cause all other pending items to incorrectly disappear from the view until the page was refreshed. The state update logic has been refactored to be more precise, ensuring a stable and predictable UI for administrators.

-   **Week of October 2, 2025 (v0.5.15):**

-   **Week of September 25, 2025 (v0.5.14):**
    -   **Enhanced Login Notifications:** Overhauled the login notification system for a more informative and user-friendly experience. The new popup includes a "Daily Briefing" that lists all required quests for the day, providing an immediate action list. Notifications are now grouped by type (e.g., "New Quests," "Approvals"), and users have two dismissal options: "Acknowledge & Continue" to mark notifications as read, and "Remind Me Later" to hide them for the current session while keeping them unread for the next login.

-   **Week of September 25, 2025 (v0.5.13):**

-   **Week of February 7, 2026 (v0.5.9):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Dimness Fix:** Reworked the Kiosk Mode dimming control to be more intuitive. It now uses a "Screen Brightness" slider where lower values correctly result in a dimmer screen (higher opacity), addressing user confusion about the dimness level's effect.

-   **Week of January 31, 2026 (v0.5.8):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Enhancements:** Overhauled the auto-dimming feature for shared devices. It is now exclusively active in Kiosk Mode, uses the globally-managed screen dimming overlay for reliability, and respects the dimness level set in the admin settings.
    -   **Dimness Preview:** Added a "Preview" button in the Kiosk Mode settings, allowing administrators to test the configured dimness level for 5 seconds.
    -   **UI Cleanup:** Removed the redundant manual "Dim Screen" toggle from the user profile dropdown.

-   **Week of January 10, 2025 (v0.5.5):**
    -   **Quest Timers:** Implemented a new feature allowing administrators to add timers to quests. This includes a "Stopwatch" mode for tracking time spent and a "Countdown" mode for tasks requiring a minimum duration (e.g., reading for 20 minutes).
    -   **Persistent Timer Widget:** When a timed quest is started, a persistent widget appears in the header, allowing users to navigate the app while keeping track of their active quest. Clicking the widget returns the user to the quest details.

    -   **Rank & Leaderboard Logic Overhaul:** Ranks and the main Leaderboard are now calculated based on a user's *total lifetime XP earned from quests*, rather than their current XP balance.

    -   **Global Condition Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete. The global condition check now correctly excludes the quest being evaluated from its own group's completion requirements.

-   **Week of October 20, 2025 (v0.4.25):**
    -   **Conditional Market Unlocks:** Locked markets now show a dialog detailing the specific conditions a user must meet to gain access, mirroring the functionality of locked quests.
    -   **Global Conditions:** Introduced "Global" condition sets that can lock content across the entire application, providing a new layer of administrative control.
    -   **Circular Dependency Fix:** Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.
    -   **Refactored Logic:** Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.

-   **Week of September 29, 2025 (v0.1.96 - v0.3.0):**
    -   **Kiosk Mode Overhaul:** Re-architected Kiosk Mode to be a more stable URL-based system (`/kiosk`), patching critical security and login flow bugs.
    -   **AI Foundations:** Implemented the backend foundation for the AI Teacher feature with stateful chat sessions.

-   **Week of September 22, 2025 (v0.1.90 - v0.1.95):**

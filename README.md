# Task Donegeon

**Version:** 0.4.24

Task Donegeon is a gamified task and chore management application designed for families, groups, or individuals. It turns everyday responsibilities into an engaging medieval-themed role-playing game. Users complete "quests" (tasks), earn virtual currency and experience points (XP), customize their avatars, and level up their characters in a fun and motivating environment. It leverages a powerful backend to persist all data and includes unique features like an **Asset Library** full of pre-made content and a **Suggestion Engine** powered by Google Gemini to help administrators generate new quests and items, making world-building a breeze.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Here is the planned development path for Task Donegeon, prioritized for the most impactful features first.

### Phase 1: Foundational Features & Quality of Life
-   **Backend Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication to secure all backend API endpoints.
-   **Enhanced Security:** A comprehensive security audit and implementation of best practices like strict input validation, Content Security Policy (CSP), and secure headers.
-   **Quest Bundles:** Group quests into "Quest Chains" or "Storylines." This allows admins to create multi-step adventures.
-   **Showcase Page:** A public profile page for each explorer to showcase their avatar, earned trophies, and key stats.
-   **Advanced Object Manager:** Implement bulk editing, quick duplication, and powerful filtering/sorting for all game objects.
-   **Improved Progress Page:** A more detailed summary of user activity, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement with visual charts.

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay & Personalization
-   **User-Created Content:** A system allowing Explorers to design their own quests and items, then submit them to admins for approval. This fosters creativity and allows the game world to be co-created by its members.
-   **Reward Rework:** Overhaul the reward system to allow for more complex and interesting rewards, such as items that grant temporary bonuses or unlock special abilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Task Donegeon, you'll need Node.js and npm installed. The application is designed to be self-contained and run easily on your local machine or a server.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm

### Environment Variables
For full functionality, especially the AI Suggestion Engine, you need to configure environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

```env
# (Required for AI Features) Your Google Gemini API Key
# Get one from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# (Optional, Recommended for Production) A long, random, secret string for signing authentication tokens.
JWT_SECRET="your_long_random_secret_string"

# (Optional, Recommended for Production) The path where the application's data (database, assets) will be stored.
# This is crucial for persistent data when using Docker.
APP_DATA_PATH="./data"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Running

### Using `npm` (for local development)
1.  **Install dependencies** for both the frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install --prefix backend
    ```
2.  **Build the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix backend
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using Docker (recommended for production)
A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are included for easy containerization.
1.  **Ensure you have a `.env` file** in the root directory with your `API_KEY` and a secure `JWT_SECRET`.
2.  **Build and run the container** using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
3.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Your data will be persisted in a `data` directory created in the project root, as mapped in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

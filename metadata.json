  "version": "0.5.51",
  "description": "This major update massively expands the 'Math Muncher' minigame with a full curriculum for grades 1-6, featuring dozens of unique, auto-generated challenges. Gameplay has been polished based on user feedback: the power-up spawn rate has been reduced for better balance, and power-ups can now be collected with the 'Munch' action. A critical stability issue causing random crashes when the player is hit has been fixed. The game now displays the player's current balance for any earnable rewards and shows a clear animation when more are gained. Finally, enemy AI has been improved for more varied and challenging movement patterns.",

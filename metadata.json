  "version": "0.5.53",
  "description": "Fixed a critical bug where changing a quest's interactive media type (e.g., from Video to PDF) would not properly clear the old media data, potentially leading to data corruption and application errors. The quest editor now correctly nullifies data from unused media types upon saving.",

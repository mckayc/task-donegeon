  "version": "0.5.49",
  "description": "This update implements significant improvements to the 'Math Muncher' minigame based on user feedback. Troggle (enemy) movement is now more dynamic and less predictable. A clearer, longer animation and a brief game pause now occur when the player is hit, improving visual feedback. The logic for selecting different troggle types has been fixed to ensure a proper variety of enemies appear. The spawn rate for in-game power-ups has also been increased.",

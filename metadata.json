  "version": "0.5.50",
  "description": "This update implements significant improvements to the 'Math Muncher' minigame based on user feedback. The spawn rate for power-ups has been reduced for better balance, and they can now be collected with the 'Munch' action. A critical bug causing random crashes when the player is hit has been fixed. The game now displays the user's current balance for earnable rewards and shows a clear animation when more are gained. Enemy AI has also been improved for more varied and challenging gameplay.",

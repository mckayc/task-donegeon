                <li><strong>The Arcade Expansion:</strong> Five new minigames have been added to the Arcade: Dragon's Dice (Farkle), Rune Breaker, Dungeon Dash, Forge Master, and Archer's Folly.</li>
                <li><strong>Arcade Leaderboard:</strong> A new "All-Time Arcade Legends" leaderboard now appears in the Arcade, showing the top players based on cumulative scores across all games.</li>
                <li><strong>High Score Display:</strong> Each minigame card now displays the name of the current global high score holder.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                <li><strong>Snake Minigame Overhaul:</strong> The Snake minigame in the Arcade has been significantly improved for better playability. The game window is now larger, the initial speed is slower, a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown has been added, and players can now restart the game by pressing any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Condition Fix:</strong> Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete. The global condition check now correctly excludes the quest being evaluated from its own group's completion requirements.</li>

                <li><strong>Conditional Market Unlocks:</strong> Locked markets now show a dialog detailing the specific conditions a user must meet to gain access, mirroring the functionality of locked quests.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Conditions:</strong> Introduced "Global" condition sets that can lock content across the entire application, providing a new layer of administrative control.</li>
                <li><strong>Circular Dependency Fix:</strong> Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.</li>
                <li><strong>Refactored Logic:</strong> Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.</li>

                <li><strong>Build Stability Fixes:</strong> Resolved a recurring TypeScript JSX error in the help guide that was causing build failures.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced AI Teacher:</strong> The AI Teacher is now a more effective and engaging tutor with personalized content, better question handling, and lesson summaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Revamped Kiosk Mode:</strong> Kiosk Mode has been completely re-engineered to be a persistent, device-specific setting activated by admins.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Manual Adjustments:</strong> Overhauled the "Manual Adjustment" dialog for more flexibility in awarding rewards and trophies, including 16 new birthday trophies.</li>

                <li><strong>AI Teacher Launch:</strong> Developed and launched the full AI Teacher feature, moving from a backend foundation to a full-screen UI with an interactive "Teach, Check, Feedback" loop and robust tool-calling for quizzes.</li>
                <li><strong>UI & UX Improvements:</strong> Fixed issues with AI Teacher button responsiveness and made minor improvements to Kiosk Mode and item approval defaults.</li>

        <h3>Exchange Rate Clarity</h3>
        <p>To improve user understanding and transparency in the Exchange Post, the direct conversion rate between the two selected reward types is now prominently displayed.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Live Calculation:</strong> As soon as a "Pay" and "Receive" currency are selected, the system calculates and shows the one-to-one exchange rate (e.g., "1 Gem ðŸ’Ž = 20 Diligence ðŸ§¹").</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Way Display:</strong> The inverse rate is also shown in a smaller font for complete clarity (e.g., "1 Diligence ðŸ§¹ = 0.05 Gems ðŸ’Ž").</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> This display updates instantly if the user changes their selected currencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reward Exchange Control</h3>
        <p>Administrators now have granular control over which rewards can be traded in the Exchange Post.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>"Include in Exchange" Toggle:</strong> A new toggle has been added to the "Edit Reward" dialog. This option is available for any reward type that has a "Base Value" greater than zero.</li>
            <li><strong>Default Behavior:</strong> By default, all existing and new valuable rewards are included in the exchange to maintain previous functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Exchange UI:</strong> The Exchange Post will now only display currencies and points that are explicitly enabled for exchange, providing a cleaner and more controlled trading experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Blueprint & Backup/Restore Fixes</h3>
        <p>A set of critical bugs affecting data portability have been resolved:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Blueprint User Imports:</strong> Fixed an issue where users exported in a blueprint JSON file would not appear in the import preview dialog. The system now correctly identifies users by their username, ensuring successful imports.</li>
            <li><strong>JSON & SQLite Restore:</strong> Overhauled the Backup & Restore functionality. Restoring from a JSON backup now correctly repopulates the entire database. Restoring from an SQLite backup no longer incorrectly triggers the first-run wizard and now correctly re-initializes the database connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Real-Time UI Updates</h3>
        <p>A comprehensive fix has been implemented to address state synchronization issues across the application. Previously, actions such as creating, updating, or deleting assets (like Quests, Items, Markets, etc.) would not immediately reflect in the user interface, requiring a page refresh to see the changes. This has been resolved.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Instant Feedback:</strong> All create, update, and clone actions on management pages now immediately update the application's state with the data returned from the server. This ensures that the UI always shows the most current information without any delay.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized Deletion:</strong> Deletion actions now use a more robust callback system. When items are deleted, they are instantly removed from the view on the management pages, providing a much smoother and more intuitive administrative experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Quest Group Management:</strong> Fixed a bug where creating, editing, or deleting a Quest Group would not update the UI until the page was refreshed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dashboard Customization</h3>
        <p>The dashboard customization experience has been enhanced for better usability:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Layout Editor:</strong> In the "Customize Dashboard" popup, the columns for "Main", "Side", and "Hidden" cards are now equal height for a cleaner visual layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Movement:</strong> In addition to drag-and-drop, each card in the editor now features arrow icons, allowing for quick movement between columns with a single click.</li>
            <li><strong>Single-Column Mode:</strong> A bug was fixed where cards from the "Side" column would become hidden when switching to the "single-column" layout. Now, all visible cards from both columns are correctly consolidated into one list, and can be moved to and from the "Hidden" section.</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicate Card Fix:</strong> Resolved a logic error where moving a card from its default column could cause it to appear in both the new and old columns simultaneously. The layout system now correctly handles new and moved cards to prevent duplication.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dynamic Rules Engine</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Quest Group Exemptions:</strong> Added the ability to exempt entire Quest Groups from "Global" Condition Sets. This allows administrators to create categories of quests (e.g., "Essential Daily Chores") that will always be available, regardless of other global rules that might be in effect (like a "Weekend Only" rule).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Quest Logic & Availability</h3>
        <p>To ensure fairness and clarity, the system now enforces stricter availability rules for quests:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Scheduled Duties:</strong> Duties (recurring quests) that are not scheduled to be active on the current day will now be fully disabled. While they may still appear dimmed on the Quest Page for informational purposes, they cannot be selected or completed until their scheduled day. This prevents accidental completions on non-active days and clarifies user expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Quest Completion Timing:</strong> Server-side validation has been strengthened to strictly enforce quest deadlines. The system now prevents users from submitting a quest completion after its defined "incomplete" time has passed. This resolves an issue where completions could be logged with a timestamp that was after the quest's cutoff, ensuring that all completion data is accurate and adheres to the established rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rank & Leaderboard Calculations</h3>
        <p>
            To provide a more accurate measure of a user's overall progress, Ranks and the Leaderboard are now calculated based on the <strong>total lifetime Experience Points (XP) earned from completing quests</strong>. This is different from the <em>current XP balance</em>, which can change as rewards are spent. This change ensures that a user's rank reflects their total effort, not just their current wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Rank Card on the Dashboard has been updated to display both your current balance and your total earned values for XP and currencies, offering a complete picture of your in-game economy.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Media</h3>
        <p>
            Certain quests can now include interactive elements to make them more engaging or educational.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>
                <strong>AI Teacher:</strong> This turns a quest into a full-screen, interactive lesson. The AI gauges the user's knowledge with a pre-quiz, creates a personalized lesson using relatable examples from the user's profile, and confirms understanding with a final quiz. Passing this quiz is required to complete the quest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Story Teller:</strong> This feature generates a unique, short story based on the quest's title and description, turning a simple chore into a narrative adventure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Video:</strong> Attach a video to a quest. You can use a URL from a service like YouTube or a video file uploaded to the Asset Manager. This is perfect for instructional videos or adding a multimedia element to a quest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EPUB Reader:</strong> Attach <code>.epub</code> files to quests and read them in a full-featured reader. The interface includes controls for theme (light/dark), font size, bookmarks, and an immersive mode for distraction-free reading. A progress slider allows for quick navigation, and page turns are animated. All progress, including location, bookmarks, and total time read *for this specific book* is saved and synced across your devices. The current session time is also displayed.
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Offline Caching:</strong> The reader now downloads and caches eBooks locally on the first open for significantly faster subsequent loads and full offline access. A progress bar displays the initial download status, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PDF Reader:</strong> Attach <code>.pdf</code> files to quests. The integrated reader allows users to view documents directly in the app. It includes controls for page navigation, zooming, and fullscreen mode. The reader automatically saves the user's last viewed page and total time read *for this specific document*, allowing you to pick up where you left off. The file is also downloaded for faster loading and offline access.
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Navigation Stability Fix:</strong> Resolved a state synchronization bug that caused the page number to revert to its previously saved state immediately after navigating to a new page. The reading experience is now smooth and stable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Arcade & Minigames</h3>
        <p>The "Arcade" is a special market where users can spend "Game Tokens" to play minigames.</p>
         <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Dragon's Dice (Farkle):</strong> A classic dice game of risk and reward. Roll the dice and set aside scoring combinations. Bust, and you lose your points for the turn. Know when to stop and bank your score to reach the goal!
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Bug Fix & UI Improvement:</strong> Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes fail to recognize a "bust," causing it to get stuck. When you bust now, a large, impactful "BUSTED!" message will appear to make the outcome clear.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rune Breaker:</strong> A fantasy-themed version of the classic *Breakout*. Control a magical shield and bounce an orb to break rows of enchanted runes.</li>
            <li><strong>Dungeon Dash:</strong> A simple side-scrolling "endless runner." An adventurer runs automatically, and the player taps to make them jump over pits and slide under obstacles.</li>
            <li><strong>Forge Master:</strong> A rhythm and timing game. The player must click at the right moment to strike a piece of hot metal with a hammer to forge a powerful weapon.</li>
            <li><strong>Archer's Folly:</strong> An archery game where the player clicks and drags to aim their bow, hitting a series of moving targets. The game now includes a power meter and a trajectory line to help players aim. The difficulty also gradually increases, with targets getting smaller and faster as the score increases.</li>
            <li><strong>Snake:</strong> The classic game of snake. The game now features a larger play area, a slower starting speed, and a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown. You can also press any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen to instantly start a new game. On-screen controls are now always visible on tablet-sized devices to ensure playability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Arcade Leaderboard</h4>
        <p>The Arcade now features an "All-Time Arcade Legends" leaderboard. It shows the top 5 players based on their <strong>cumulative scores</strong> across <strong>all</strong> minigames. Additionally, each individual game card now proudly displays the name of the current high score holder for that game.</p>
        <h3>Bug Tracker & Reporting</h3>
        <p>
            The built-in Bug Tracker includes features to help admins triage and process feedback efficiently.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>
                <strong>Comment Actions:</strong> In the Bug Detail popup, comments added to a report have quick actions to help with review. You can dim comments that have been processed, and mark comments with a green (good/implemented) or red (for review/invalid) background. These controls are always visible on each comment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Log Templates:</strong> Admins can create text templates that can be automatically appended to the clipboard when copying bug logs, standardizing communication with external tools or developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Consolidated UI:</strong> The bug recording bar has been consolidated into a more compact and responsive layout to ensure all controls are accessible, even on smaller screens with long report titles.
            </li>

                <li><strong>Arcade UX & Gameplay Improvements:</strong> Made several enhancements to the Arcade. The "Play" button on game cards is now a primary, full-width button for better visibility.

                <li><strong>Dashboard Customization UX Improvements:</strong> Overhauled the "Customize Dashboard" dialog for better usability. The layout editor columns now have equal heights for a cleaner look. Cards can now be moved between main, side, and hidden columns using new arrow icons, providing an alternative to drag-and-drop.

                <li><strong>Rank & Leaderboard Logic Overhaul:</strong> Ranks and the main Leaderboard are now calculated based on a user's *total lifetime XP earned from quests*, rather than their current XP balance. This provides a more accurate and fair representation of a user's overall progress that isn't affected by spending rewards. The Rank Card on the dashboard has been updated to display both current balances and total earned values for clarity.</li>

                <li><strong>Global Condition Fix:</strong> Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete.

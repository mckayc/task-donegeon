                    <p>Every member of your {settings.terminology.group} has a role that defines what they can do:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                        <li><strong>{settings.terminology.admin}:</strong> The game administrator. They can create and manage all users, {settings.terminology.tasks}, {settings.terminology.stores}, {settings.terminology.groups}, and settings. They have the ultimate authority.</li>
                        <li><strong>{settings.terminology.moderator}:</strong> A helper role. They can approve or reject {settings.terminology.task} completions, assisting the {settings.terminology.admin} in managing the game's day-to-day activity.</li>
                        <li><strong>{settings.terminology.user}:</strong> The standard player role. They complete {settings.terminology.tasks}, earn {settings.terminology.points}, and customize their character.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Personal vs. {settings.terminology.group} Mode</h3>
                    <p>The app has two primary contexts, which you can switch between using the dropdown in the header:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Personal Mode:</strong> This is your individual space. {settings.terminology.tasks} you complete here add to your personal balances of currency and XP. You can spend this personal currency in personal {settings.terminology.stores}.<br/><em>Example: A personal {settings.terminology.task} might be "Read a chapter of a book" or "Practice piano for 30 minutes".</em></li>
                        <li><strong>{settings.terminology.group} Mode:</strong> When you switch to a {settings.terminology.group}, you'll see {settings.terminology.tasks} and {settings.terminology.stores} specific to that group. Rewards earned here go into your balance for that specific {settings.terminology.group}, creating a separate economy. This is perfect for family chores or group projects.<br/><em>Example: A {settings.terminology.group} {settings.terminology.task} might be "Help clean the kitchen after dinner" or "Rake the leaves in the yard".</em></li>

        <h3>Interactive Media</h3>
        <p>
            Certain quests can now include interactive elements to make them more engaging or educational.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>
                <strong>AI Teacher:</strong> This turns a quest into a full-screen, interactive lesson. The AI gauges the user's knowledge with a pre-quiz, creates a personalized lesson using relatable examples from the user's profile, and confirms understanding with a final quiz. Passing this quiz is required to complete the quest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Story Teller:</strong> This feature generates a unique, short story based on the quest's title and description, turning a simple chore into a narrative adventure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Video:</strong> Attach a video to a quest. You can use a URL from a service like YouTube or a video file uploaded to the Asset Manager. This is perfect for instructional videos or adding a multimedia element to a quest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EPUB Reader:</strong> Attach <code>.epub</code> files to quests. Users can open a full-featured reader to read books directly within the app. Progress (location, bookmarks, time read) is now saved to the database, syncing across devices. The reader now supports fullscreen mode, light/dark themes, and swipe gestures for turning pages.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Arcade & Minigames</h3>
        <p>The "Arcade" is a special market where users can spend "Game Tokens" to play minigames.</p>
         <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Dragon's Dice (Farkle):</strong> A classic dice game of risk and reward. Roll the dice and set aside scoring combinations. Bust, and you lose your points for the turn. Know when to stop and bank your score to reach the goal!
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Bug Fix & UI Improvement:</strong> Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes fail to recognize a "bust," causing it to get stuck. When you bust now, a large, impactful "BUSTED!" message will appear to make the outcome clear.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rune Breaker:</strong> A fantasy-themed version of the classic *Breakout*. Control a magical shield and bounce an orb to break rows of enchanted runes.</li>
            <li><strong>Dungeon Dash:</strong> A simple side-scrolling "endless runner." An adventurer runs automatically, and the player taps to make them jump over pits and slide under obstacles.</li>
            <li><strong>Forge Master:</strong> A rhythm and timing game. The player must click at the right moment to strike a piece of hot metal with a hammer to forge a powerful weapon.</li>
            <li><strong>Archer's Folly:</strong> An archery game where the player clicks and drags to aim their bow, hitting a series of moving targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Snake:</strong> The classic game of snake. The game now features a larger play area, a slower starting speed, and a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown. You can also press any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen to instantly start a new game.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Arcade Leaderboard</h4>
        <p>The Arcade now features an "All-Time Arcade Legends" leaderboard. It shows the top 5 players based on their <strong>cumulative scores</strong> across <strong>all</strong> minigames. Additionally, each individual game card now proudly displays the name of the current high score holder for that game.</p>

                <li><strong>Backend Authentication:</strong> Implement JWT-based authentication to secure all backend API endpoints.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> A comprehensive security audit and implementation of best practices like strict input validation, Content Security Policy (CSP), and secure headers.</li>
                <li><strong>Quest Bundles:</strong> Group quests into "Quest Chains" or "Storylines." This allows admins to create multi-step adventures.</li>
                <li><strong>Showcase Page:</strong> A public profile page for each explorer to showcase their avatar, earned trophies, and key stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Object Manager:</strong> Implement bulk editing, quick duplication, and powerful filtering/sorting for all game objects.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                <li><strong>User-Created Content:</strong> A system allowing Explorers to design their own quests and items, then submit them to admins for approval. This fosters creativity and allows the game world to be co-created by its members.</li>
                <li><strong>Reward Rework:</strong> Overhaul the reward system to allow for more complex and interesting rewards, such as items that grant temporary bonuses or unlock special abilities.</li>

                <li><strong>Media Library Enhancements:</strong> Added the ability to create folders, fixed upload paths, and implemented drag-and-drop for files and folders in the media library.</li>

                <li><strong>Snake Minigame Overhaul:</strong> The Snake minigame in the Arcade has been significantly improved for better playability. The game window is now larger, the initial speed is slower, a "3, 2, 1, GO!" countdown has been added, and players can now restart the game by pressing any arrow key on the "Game Over" screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Condition Fix:</strong> Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest that was part of a quest group used in a *globally applied* condition set would lock itself, making it impossible to complete.

                <li><strong>Global Conditions:</strong> Introduced "Global" condition sets that can lock content across the entire application, providing a new layer of administrative control.</li>
                <li><strong>Circular Dependency Fix:</strong> Resolved a critical logic bug where a quest could be locked by a condition requiring the completion of its own quest group. The system now intelligently ignores the quest being checked when evaluating its group's completion status.</li>
                <li><strong>Refactored Logic:</strong> Refactored the internal condition checking logic to be more robust and consistent between quests and markets.</li>

# Welcome to the {appName} Help Guide

This guide is the single source of truth for how {appName} works. It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for both players ({users}) and administrators ({admin}s). The terminology used here (like "{task}", "{group}", etc.) is dynamic and will always match what you've configured in the Settings page.

## The Basics: Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts is key to mastering {appName}.

### Roles: Who's Who?
Every member of your {group} has a role that defines what they can do:
- **{admin}:** The game administrator. They can create and manage all users, {tasks}, {stores}, {groups}, and settings. They have the ultimate authority.
- **{moderator}:** A helper role. They can approve or reject {task} completions, assisting the {admin} in managing the game's day-to-day activity.
- **{user}:** The standard player role. They complete {tasks}, earn {points}, and customize their character.

### Personal vs. {group} Mode
The app has two primary contexts, which you can switch between using the dropdown in the header:
- **Personal Mode:** This is your individual space. {tasks} you complete here add to your personal balances of currency and XP. You can spend this personal currency in personal {stores}.
  _Example: A personal {task} might be "Read a chapter of a book" or "Practice piano for 30 minutes"._
- **{group} Mode:** When you switch to a {group}, you'll see {tasks} and {stores} specific to that group. Rewards earned here go into your balance for that specific {group}, creating a separate economy. This is perfect for family chores or group projects.
  _Example: A {group} {task} might be "Help clean the kitchen after dinner" or "Rake the leaves in the yard"._

### The Three {task} Types
All tasks fall into one of three categories:
- **{recurringTasks}:** These are repeating tasks that happen on a schedule. They are great for building habits. For {recurringTasks} with a specific time, you can set a **Due Time** (the deadline) and an optional **Incomplete Time** (the final cutoff). The time between these two appears on the calendar as a colored "late period" to show the grace period before penalties are applied.
  _Example: "Take out the trash every Tuesday" or "Make your bed every morning"._
- **{singleTasks}:** These are one-time tasks or projects. They can be completable once, or have a certain number of available "slots" for multiple people to complete.
  _Example: "Organize the garage" (completable once) or "Help wash the car" (could have 2 slots)._
- **{journeys}:** These are epic, multi-step adventures. Each {journey} is made of several 'checkpoints' that must be completed in order.
  _Example: A "Book Report" {journey} might have checkpoints like "Read the Book", "Write the Draft", and "Finalize the Report"._

## Functional Specifications

This section serves as the definitive source of truth for the application's intended functionality.

### {link_approvals} Page Responsiveness
The {link_approvals} page is fully responsive to provide an optimal experience on any device.
-   **Desktop View:** On larger screens, the page displays a comprehensive table for each approval type (Quests, Claims, Purchases, Trades). This view is optimized for reviewing many items at once and performing quick actions.
-   **Mobile View:** On mobile devices, the page automatically switches to a touch-friendly card layout. Each pending item is displayed on its own card within a categorized section. For Quests and Claims, you can tap the main body of the card to view the full details of the {task} before making a decision. Quick actions to approve or reject are available directly on each card.

### {task} Card Visual System
To provide at-a-glance information, all {task} cards (on the {link_quests} page, Dashboard, Kiosk Mode, etc.) share a consistent visual system.

#### Background Colors
Each {task} type has a unique background color to make it easily distinguishable. These colors are based on the current theme.
-   `{recurringTask}:` Blueish background (`bg-sky-900/30`)
-   `{singleTask}:` Amber/Orange background (`bg-amber-900/30`)
-   `{journey}:` Purple background (`bg-purple-900/30`)

#### Dimmed States
{tasks} that are not currently actionable are dimmed to de-emphasize them.
-   **Completed:** Any {task} that has been completed for the day will remain on screen but appear dimmed.
-   **Incomplete:** Any `{recurringTask}` that is past its final "Incomplete Time" for the day will be dimmed.

#### Border Colors & Animations
The border of a {task} card indicates its urgency and status.
-   `Solid Border:` Indicates the {task} is **required**.
-   `Dashed Border:` Indicates the {task} is **optional**.
-   `Green Border:` The {task} is due in **more than 2 hours**.
-   `Yellow Border:` The {task} is due in **1-2 hours**.
-   `Orange Border (Pulsing):` The {task} is due in **less than 1 hour**. This animation draws attention to its urgency.
-   `Red Border (Pulsing):` The {task} is **past its due time** but can still be completed before it is marked incomplete.
-   `Black Border:` The {task} is now **incomplete** for the day and cannot be completed (applies mainly to {recurringTasks} with an `endTime`).

#### Time Display
-   **Time Remaining:** For {tasks} with a deadline, the card will show the time remaining (e.g., "Due in: 2d 3h", "Due in: 45m").
-   **Absolute Date:** The full due date and time is also shown for clarity (e.g., "Due: Sep 20, 2025, 5:00 PM").
-   **Past Due:** If a {task} is past its due time but still completable, the text will turn red and show "Past Due" or, if applicable, the time remaining until it is marked "Incomplete" (e.g., "Incomplete in: 30m").
-   **No Deadline:** {tasks} without a specific deadline will show "No due date".

### Shared / Kiosk Mode
**Purpose:** This mode is for shared family devices. It provides a fast user-switching interface and can automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.

**How it Works:**
- When enabled, logging out or clicking "Exit" in the header goes to a Kiosk screen. This screen defaults to a calendar view of today's available {tasks} for each selected user.
- The header displays avatars and **usernames** for quick login. It also has icons to switch between the **Calendar View** (üóìÔ∏è) and the **Leaderboard View** (üìä).
- The calendar view is categorized into "{recurringTasks}" and "{singleTasks} & {journeys}" for each user to improve clarity.
- {task} cards in Kiosk Mode use the same visual border system as the main {link_quests} page, providing at-a-glance status information.
- **Updating:** When an application update is available, a toast notification will appear at the bottom-left of the screen. Additionally, a persistent "Update" icon (an arrow pointing down into a tray) will appear in the header. Clicking either of these will install the update.
- **Pending Notifications:** If a user has items awaiting approval, a red notification badge will appear on their avatar in the header.

#### {task} Visibility in Kiosk Mode
A {task} will only appear in Kiosk Mode if it is relevant for **today**. It must meet one of the following criteria:
-   A **{recurringTask}** scheduled to run today.
-   A **{singleTask}** or **{journey}** whose start date is today.
-   A **{singleTask}** that the user has manually marked as a "To-Do".
-   An optional, dateless **{singleTask}** that is configured with a daily completion limit. These now appear automatically without needing to be a "To-Do".

**Completing {tasks} in Kiosk Mode:**
- If enabled, users can click a {task} to open its detail view and complete it.
- If **"Require PIN for quest completion"** is enabled, the user must enter their PIN to confirm. Otherwise, the {task} is completed immediately.

### {link_triumphs_trials}
**Purpose:** This system allows {admin}s to apply immediate or temporary effects to users, either as a reward ({triumph}) or a consequence ({trial}). This is ideal for handling situations that fall outside the normal {task} system, like rewarding exceptional behavior or enforcing house rules.

**How it Works:**
The `Manage Triumphs & Trials` page is split into three sections:
1.  **Definitions:** Here, {admin}s create reusable templates for Triumphs and Trials. A definition includes a name, icon, and one or more **effects**.
2.  **Active Modifiers:** This section lists any **duration-based** effects that are currently active on a user (e.g., a 24-hour market closure).
3.  **Modifier Application History:** This is a comprehensive, paginated log of **every** Triumph and Trial that has ever been applied to any user. It provides a complete audit trail of all manual adjustments. You can control how many items are shown per page and navigate through the history.

**Types of Effects:**
There are two main types of effects, and they behave very differently:
-   **Instantaneous Effects:** These are one-time actions that happen immediately and are finished.
    -   **Examples:** `Grant Rewards`, `Deduct Rewards`.
    -   **Behavior:** When a Triumph/Trial with only these effects is applied, it does **not** create a persistent "Active Modifier". Instead, the user's balances are adjusted instantly, and a single entry is created in the `{history}` log to record what happened.

-   **Duration-Based Effects:** These are ongoing effects that last for a specific period.
    -   **Examples:** `Close Market`, `Open Market`, `Market Discount`.
    -   **Behavior:** When a Triumph/Trial containing any of these effects is applied, it **does** create an "Active Modifier" that is tracked in the "Active Modifiers" list until it expires. The `{history}` is still updated to inform the user that the effect has started.

### {link_chronicles}
**Purpose:** The {history} provides a comprehensive log of all significant actions within the application for motivational and auditing purposes.

#### Dashboard "Recent Activity" Widget
-   **Time-Limited:** Shows activity from the last **7 days**.
-   **Count-Limited:** Displays up to **50 events**, or **all events from today** if that number is greater than 50.

#### What Creates a {history} Event?
The system logs every significant step in a process to provide a clear audit trail.
-   **Quest Completion:** Records when a {task} is completed, approved, or rejected.
-   **Quest Claiming:** Logs when a {task} is claimed, unclaimed, or has its claim approved/rejected.
-   **Quest To-Do:** Logs when a {task} is marked as a To-Do or removed from the To-Do list.
-   **Purchase:** Logs when an item purchase is requested, approved, rejected, or cancelled from a {store}.
-   **Trophy Awarded:** Appears when a user unlocks a new {award}.
-   **Admin Adjustment:** Shows when an {admin} manually gives or takes away {points}.
-   **Admin Asset Management:** Logs when an {admin} creates or deletes assets (e.g., {tasks}, users, items).
-   **Gift Received:** Records when a user receives a gift.
-   **Trade:** Logs the initiation, update, and completion of trades.
-   **Exchange:** Logs when a user exchanges currencies at the Exchange Post.
-   **Crafting:** Appears when a user crafts a new item.
-   **Triumph/Trial:** Logs when an {admin} applies a Triumph or Trial to a user.
-   **System:** Logs automated system actions, such as applying {negativePoints}.

#### {history} Consolidation Logic
To prevent clutter, some admin actions are consolidated.
-   **Consolidate:** If an {admin} creates or deletes multiple assets of the same type in a row (e.g., creating 5 {tasks}), it will be grouped into a single {history} entry, like `Created 5 {tasks}`. The action "chain" is broken if the {admin} performs a different type of action.
-   **Do NOT Consolidate:** All other user-facing actions are logged individually. For example, if a user marks a {task} as a to-do, completes it, an admin rejects it, the user completes it again, and an admin approves it, you will see **5 distinct {history} entries** for that {task}.
-   **Full Audit Trail:** Multi-step processes are now logged at each stage to provide a complete history. For example, when an item is purchased:
    -   A `{history}` entry is created when the user first **requests** the item.
    -   A *new, separate* `{history}` entry is created when an {admin} **approves** or **rejects** the request, or when the user **cancels** it.

#### Richer {history} UI
- **Clearer Purchase UI:** To prevent confusion, the cost of a purchase is only shown on the initial "Requested" event. Subsequent "Completed" events show a confirmation message, and "Rejected" or "Cancelled" events show an explicit refund.
- **Visual Purchase Context:** Purchase events now show the specific item's image instead of a generic icon, falling back to the {store}'s icon if no image is available.

### Quest Claiming
**Purpose:** The "Claim" feature prevents multiple {users} from working on the same single-person {task}.

**Admin Setup:**
- In the "Create/Edit Quest" dialog, a **"Requires Claim Before Starting"** toggle is available for {singleTasks} and {journeys}.
- A **"Claim Limit"** can be set (default is 1).

**User Workflow:**
1.  A {user} clicks **"Claim {task}"** in the detail view. Their request is sent for approval.
2.  The {task} now shows as "Claimed by [User]" for others. The "Claim" button is disabled if the limit is reached.
3.  {admin}s see the request in the **"Pending Claims"** tab on the {link_approvals} page.
4.  If approved, the claiming {user} is notified and can now complete the {task}. Completing it releases their claim.
5.  If rejected, the claim is removed and the slot becomes available.
6.  An {admin} can **"Force Unclaim"** a {task} from the "Manage Quests" page to clear all pending/approved claims.

### Bug Tracker
**Purpose:** A tool for `{admin}`s to systematically track bugs, feedback, and feature requests.

**How it Works:**
- A reporting bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to start recording a session.
- During a session, it logs navigation, state changes, and optionally, user clicks and element details.
- {admin}s can add manual notes, use a special "picker" to identify specific UI elements, and even enable temporary server-side logging for deep debugging.
- All reports are managed on the **{link_bug_tracker}** page, where they can be tagged, commented on, and have their status updated.
- A bug report can be converted into a new {task} with a single click, automatically populating the {task} description with the bug's details.

### UI Components and Controls
- **Number Inputs:** The number input fields throughout the app (used for setting rewards, costs, etc.) have been enhanced.
    - The input field is now wide enough to display at least 4 digits clearly.
    - You can click the `+` and `-` buttons to increment or decrement the value.
    - You can **click and hold** the `+` or `-` buttons to rapidly change the value after a short delay, making it faster to adjust numbers significantly.

### What's New in Version 0.1.84 (September 17, 2025)
-   **Consistent Quest Card Styling:** The "Quick Actions" widget on the Dashboard now uses the same detailed styling as the main Quests page, including dynamic, color-coded borders to indicate due dates and status for a more consistent user experience.
-   **Slower "Due Soon" Animation:** The pulsing animation for quest cards that are due soon has been slowed down to be less jarring.

### What's New in Version 0.1.83 (September 16, 2025)
-   **Visible Quest Rewards:** The "Manage Quests" page now includes a "Rewards" column in the table view and displays rewards directly on the quest cards in mobile view, making it much easier for administrators to see the rewards for each quest at a glance.

### What's New in Version 0.1.77 (September 15, 2025)
-   **Enhanced Chronicles System:** The `{history}` system has been overhauled to be more comprehensive and intelligent.
    -   **New Event Logging:** The system now logs a wider range of activities, including when a {task} is marked as a "To-Do," when an exchange is made, and when a Triumph or Trial is applied.
    -   **Consolidated Admin Logs:** To keep the `{history}` clean, consecutive creations or deletions of the same asset type by an {admin} are now grouped into a single, consolidated log entry (e.g., "Created 5 {tasks}").
    -   **More Robust Logging:** All user-facing actions are now logged individually to provide a complete audit trail.
-   **Smarter Dashboard Widget:** The "Recent Activity" widget on the Dashboard now shows events from the last **7 days** and displays up to **50 items** or all of today's events, whichever is greater, giving a more comprehensive recent overview.
-   **Updated Documentation:** The in-app `{link_help_guide}` has been thoroughly updated with these new specifications, ensuring it remains the definitive source of truth for the application's functionality.

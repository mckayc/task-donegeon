# Welcome to the {appName} Help Guide

This guide is the single source of truth for how {appName} works. It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for both players ({users}) and administrators ({admin}s). The terminology used here (like "{task}", "{group}", etc.) is dynamic and will always match what you've configured in the Settings page.

## The Basics: Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts is key to mastering {appName}.

### Roles: Who's Who?
Every member of your {group} has a role that defines what they can do:
- **{admin}:** The game administrator. They can create and manage all users, {tasks}, {stores}, {groups}, and settings. They have the ultimate authority.
- **{moderator}:** A helper role. They can approve or reject {task} completions, assisting the {admin} in managing the game's day-to-day activity.
- **{user}:** The standard player role. They complete {tasks}, earn {points}, and customize their character.

### Personal vs. {group} Mode
The app has two primary contexts, which you can switch between using the dropdown in the header:
- **Personal Mode:** This is your individual space. {tasks} you complete here add to your personal balances of currency and XP. You can spend this personal currency in personal {stores}.
  _Example: A personal {task} might be "Read a chapter of a book" or "Practice piano for 30 minutes"._
- **{group} Mode:** When you switch to a {group}, you'll see {tasks} and {stores} specific to that group. Rewards earned here go into your balance for that specific {group}, creating a separate economy. This is perfect for family chores or group projects.
  _Example: A {group} {task} might be "Help clean the kitchen after dinner" or "Rake the leaves in the yard"._

### The Three {task} Types
All tasks fall into one of three categories:
- **{recurringTasks}:** These are repeating tasks that happen on a schedule. They are great for building habits. For {recurringTasks} with a specific time, you can set a **Due Time** (the deadline) and an optional **Incomplete Time** (the final cutoff). The time between these two appears on the calendar as a colored "late period" to show the grace period before penalties are applied.
  _Example: "Take out the trash every Tuesday" or "Make your bed every morning"._
- **{singleTasks}:** These are one-time tasks or projects. They can be completable once, or have a certain number of available "slots" for multiple people to complete.
  _Example: "Organize the garage" (completable once) or "Help wash the car" (could have 2 slots)._
- **{journeys}:** These are epic, multi-step adventures. Each {journey} is made of several 'checkpoints' that must be completed in order.
  _Example: A "Book Report" {journey} might have checkpoints like "Read the Book", "Write the Draft", and "Finalize the Report"._

## Functional Specifications

This section serves as the definitive source of truth for the application's intended functionality.

### {task} Card Visual System
To provide at-a-glance information, all {task} cards (on the {link_quests} page, Dashboard, Kiosk Mode, etc.) share a consistent visual system.

#### Background Colors
Each {task} type has a unique background color to make it easily distinguishable. These colors are based on the current theme.
-   `{recurringTask}:` Blueish background (`bg-sky-900/30`)
-   `{singleTask}:` Amber/Orange background (`bg-amber-900/30`)
-   `{journey}:` Purple background (`bg-purple-900/30`)

#### Dimmed States
{tasks} that are not currently actionable are dimmed to de-emphasize them.
-   **Completed:** Any {task} that has been completed for the day will remain on screen but appear dimmed.
-   **Incomplete:** Any `{recurringTask}` that is past its final "Incomplete Time" for the day will be dimmed.

#### Border Colors & Animations
The border of a {task} card indicates its urgency and status.
-   `Solid Border:` Indicates the {task} is **required**.
-   `Dashed Border:` Indicates the {task} is **optional**.
-   `Green Border:` The {task} is due in **more than 2 hours**.
-   `Yellow Border:` The {task} is due in **1-2 hours**.
-   `Orange Border (Pulsing):` The {task} is due in **less than 1 hour**. This animation draws attention to its urgency.
-   `Red Border (Pulsing):` The {task} is **past its due time** but can still be completed before it is marked incomplete.
-   `Black Border:` The {task} is now **incomplete** for the day and cannot be completed (applies mainly to {recurringTasks} with an `endTime`).

### Shared / Kiosk Mode
**Purpose:** This mode is for shared family devices. It provides a fast user-switching interface and can automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.

**How it Works:**
- When enabled, logging out or clicking "Exit" in the header goes to a Kiosk screen. This screen defaults to a calendar view of today's available {tasks} for each selected user.
- The header displays avatars and **usernames** for quick login. It also has icons to switch between the **Calendar View** (üóìÔ∏è) and the **Leaderboard View** (üìä).
- The calendar view is categorized into "{recurringTasks}" and "{singleTasks} & {journeys}" for each user to improve clarity.
- {task} cards in Kiosk Mode use the same visual border system as the main {link_quests} page, providing at-a-glance status information.

#### {task} Visibility in Kiosk Mode
A {task} will only appear in Kiosk Mode if it is relevant for **today**. It must meet one of the following criteria:
-   A **{recurringTask}** scheduled to run today.
-   A **{singleTask}** or **{journey}** whose start date is today.
-   A **{singleTask}** that the user has manually marked as a "To-Do".
-   An optional, dateless **{singleTask}** that is configured with a daily completion limit. These now appear automatically without needing to be a "To-Do".

**Completing {tasks} in Kiosk Mode:**
- If enabled, users can click a {task} to open its detail view and complete it.
- If **"Require PIN for quest completion"** is enabled, the user must enter their PIN to confirm. Otherwise, the {task} is completed immediately.

### {link_chronicles}
**Purpose:** The {history} provides a comprehensive log of all significant actions within the application for motivational and auditing purposes. The dashboard widget shows the last 7 days of activity, while the main page is a full, filterable history.

**Event Breakdown:**
- **Quest Completion:** Records when a {task} is completed, approved, or rejected.
- **Purchase:** Logs when an item is purchased from a {store}.
- **Trophy Awarded:** Appears when a user unlocks a new {award}.
- **Admin Adjustment:** Shows when an {admin} manually gives or takes away {points}.
- **Gift Received:** Records when a user receives a gift.
- **Trade:** Logs the initiation, update, and completion of trades.
- **Crafting:** Appears when a user crafts a new item.
- **System:** Logs automated system actions, such as applying {negativePoints}.
- **Quest Claiming:** Logs the full lifecycle of a {task} claim (claimed, approved, cancelled, etc.).

### Quest Claiming
**Purpose:** The "Claim" feature prevents multiple {users} from working on the same single-person {task}.

**Admin Setup:**
- In the "Create/Edit Quest" dialog, a **"Requires Claim Before Starting"** toggle is available for {singleTasks} and {journeys}.
- A **"Claim Limit"** can be set (default is 1).

**User Workflow:**
1.  A {user} clicks **"Claim {task}"** in the detail view. Their request is sent for approval.
2.  The {task} now shows as "Claimed by [User]" for others. The "Claim" button is disabled if the limit is reached.
3.  {admin}s see the request in the **"Pending Claims"** tab on the {link_approvals} page.
4.  If approved, the claiming {user} is notified and can now complete the {task}. Completing it releases their claim.
5.  If rejected, the claim is removed and the slot becomes available.
6.  An {admin} can **"Force Unclaim"** a {task} from the "Manage Quests" page to clear all pending/approved claims.

### Bug Tracker
**Purpose:** A tool for `{admin}`s to systematically track bugs, feedback, and feature requests.

**How it Works:**
- A reporting bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to start recording a session.
- During a session, it logs navigation, state changes, and optionally, user clicks and element details.
- {admin}s can add manual notes, use a special "picker" to identify specific UI elements, and even enable temporary server-side logging for deep debugging.
- All reports are managed on the **{link_bug_tracker}** page, where they can be tagged, commented on, and have their status updated.
- A bug report can be converted into a new {task} with a single click, automatically populating the {task} description with the bug's details.
